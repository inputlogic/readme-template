## Overview

Create a description of the project – what the repository contains, what the project name is, and any functionality contained in the project (signup, login, customizations, CRUD functionality, etc.). Describe what the user is able to do and accomplish, and what problem this app is solving.

## Architecture
​Describe the tech stack used for the project, along with any libraries, or third party tools associated with it. 

Example:

>This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and modified with some useful utilities, components, and settings that we ([Input Logic](https://github.com/inputlogic)) often need. It also contains the follow third-party libraries:
​
>- [Library Name](https://google.com)
>- [Library Name](https://google.com)
>- [Library Name](https://google.com)
​
>In order to run this project, you'll have to have to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, and should be familiar with JavaScript, React, and an understanding of the modern usage of both.

### File Structure
Provide a description with how the project is structured, with notable/important files and folders, and information on each. For example:

> The main application exists within the `src/` directory, with notable/important files and folders laid out as follows:​
> - `apps/auth/` - This contains screens pertaining to sign up and login of the application
> - `apps/profile/` - This holds the components and screens related to the 'Profile' tab when logged into the application
> - `apps/dashboard/` - This includes all screens/pages that are associated with dashboard functionality
> - `assets/` - Files like fonts and images that are used within the application
> - `consts.js` - Constant variables related to running the application and libraries
> - `elements/` - Any elements folder contains components that are relevant globally, or if nested within another folder, are tied to a specific screen/page
> - `modals/` - Contain modal popups that appear with the application
> - `store/` - Files pertaining to the application's global state
> - `styles/` - Global application styles
> - `util/` - Utility and helper functions

> The `server/` and `config/` directories contain setup and setting information for the running the application server, and the `public/` directory contains front-facing static files, such as fonts and images that are used.
​
> \*Note - other folders that are present may contain test screens, or partial features/components that are planned for future release.

## Local Development
Give a detailed description on how to get the project running, starting at cloning the repository all the way though so someone can have the project running on their machine, and contribute to the project. This should be detailed enough that anyone can pull down and start the project, regardless of skill level. If this requires a deeper understanding, or technical requirements that require training, please list this as well.

Example (it will likely be more detailed than this, especially on a mature project):

>To start working on the project you should first have a grasp on the languages and frameworks mentioned, and have have a basic understand of how `git` works. To get up and running:
​
>- Clone this repository
>- Run `npm install` in the base directory
>- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view your application, which will auto-refresh as you make code changes
>- You're ready to start contributing!

### Project Complexities
Give a detailed description of anything in the project that may be hard to understand by looking through the repository, or detailed information that may be missing in regards to how the project functions. This is to aid anyone looking at the project who needs to better understand how things are done, and why they may be done in a specific way.

### Project Gotchas
Describe any workarounds, edge cases, or anything to look out for that may promote unexpected behaviour. This should include any oddities someone may need to know when running or building the project, and also deploying it.

## API Reference
This should describe where your API documentation is located – usually this will be in Insomnia, but could also an address or location for external client API docs, or in cases where tools are used instead of standard API backends (ex. Firebase, Cloud functions, etc.)
